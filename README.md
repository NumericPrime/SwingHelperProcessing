# SwingHelperProcessing
A library for using swing components with Processing.

Adding swing components to processing is hard this library makes this process easier by adding a few classes and annotations that allow to merge a processing content with swing components. The library adds 3 classes to do that in various ways and allow including custom ways with just a few lines of code. The library also includes utility to format buttons by e.g. edit their color or strap methods onto them along with a few other QOL functions.
